	 * If you have a unique name for the listener use this constructor to avoid
	 * ever getting duplicate listeners in the SWT listener list. The unique name
	 * is used in a map of listeners rather than a list as is normally the case.
	 * 
	 * Adding too many listeners is easily done and can fire more events that are required.
	 * 
	 * For instance:
	 * 1. A choice changes and an anonymous ValueListener is added to an IFieldWidget in the callback.
	 * 2. SWT can fire listeners more than expected so two value listeners are actually added for each time the choice changes.
	 * 3. The value of the IFieldWidget widget changes and more updates are made than necessary
	 *    in the callback to the widget, which in this case reads a motor and sets another one and then does plot for instance.
	 * 4. GDA Client grinds to a halt.
	 *    
	 * Solution: If a unique name is known for a listener use that, then extra listeners will not be maintained
	 * in the listener collection. Also avoid adding listeners except in the constructor.
